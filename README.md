A neural network model for binary classification to predict hotel reservation cancellations, achieving an 84% accuracy rate on validation data. Incorporated batch normalization layers for training stability, dense layers with ReLU activation for feature extraction, and dropout layers to mitigate overfitting. Utilized Adam optimizer, cross-entropy loss function, and early stopping for further overfitting prevention.
